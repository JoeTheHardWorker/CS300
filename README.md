The problem I was solving was runtime and memory analysis for data structures for advising software and coding the software to sort and print a list of courses in alphanumeric order.

I approached this problem by storing the information in a data structure which made it easier to load and organize the information.

My biggest roadblock was attempting to develop the application in Parallels. This came earlier in the project development stage. I solved this issue by developing on a Windows PC.

This project has expanded my approach to designing software by increasing my familiarity with data structures which are a huge deal in just about every program.
